# Covid_SQL_Analysis
For this project I set out to answer questions about the COVID-19 virus. I obtained questions from friends and answered them by using SQL queries in MySQL Workbench.

I used 3 sheets which I obtained from the CDC official site and the USDA official site and imported them into MySQL Workbench. Then I used a variety of methods to answer questions pertaining to the COVID-19 virus and vaccinations around the United States.
